#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal
In this project, you will solve a regression problem with deep neural networks (DNN). You will Understand basic DNN training tips e.g. hyper-parameter tuning, feature selection, regularization, etc., and get familiar with PyTorch. This project should be completed in Python 3 and Pytorch!

## Task Description
Given survey results in the past 3 days in a specific state in U.S., then predict the percentage of new tested positive cases in the 3rd day.

For more details, please refer to the project1_slides.pdf.
