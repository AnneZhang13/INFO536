# Individual Project 2
# MNIST Image Classification

#### Due Date
* Monday Sep 21, 2025 (23:59)

#### Total Points
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal
In this project, you will classify MNIST dataset with deep neural networks. You can build any neural nets as you want, for example, you can construct fully-connected layers, or CNNs, or others. This project should be completed with Python 3 and Pytorch.

## Deliverables & Grading
